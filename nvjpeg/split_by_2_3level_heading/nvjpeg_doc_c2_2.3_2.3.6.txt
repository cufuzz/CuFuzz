2.3.6. nvJPEG API Return Codesï

The nvJPEG API adheres to the following return codes and their indicators:

typedef enum {
    NVJPEG_STATUS_SUCCESS = 0,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED = 1,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER = 2,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_BAD_JPEG = 3,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_JPEG_NOT_SUPPORTED = 4,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_ALLOCATOR_FAILURE = 5,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED = 6,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_ARCH_MISMATCH = 7,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR = 8,
    NVJPEG_STATUS_IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_SUPPORTED = 9
} nvjpegStatus_t;


Description of the returned error codes:







Returned Error (Returned Code)
Description


NVJPEG_STATUS_SUCCESS (0)
The API call has finished successfully. Note that many of the calls are asynchronous and some of the errors may be seen only after synchronization.


NVJPEG_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED (1)
The library handle was not initialized. A call to nvjpegCreate() is required to initialize the handle.


NVJPEG_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER (2)
Wrong parameter was passed. For example, a null pointer as input data, or an image index not in the allowed range.


NVJPEG_STATUS_BAD_JPEG (3)
Cannot parse the JPEG stream. Check that the encoded JPEG stream and its size parameters are correct.


NVJPEG_STATUS_JPEG_NOT_SUPPORTED (4)
Attempting to decode a JPEG stream that is not supported by the nvJPEG library.


NVJPEG_STATUS_ALLOCATOR_FAILURE (5)
The user-provided allocator functions, for either memory allocation or for releasing the memory, returned a non-zero code.


NVJPEG_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED (6)
Error during the execution of the device tasks.


NVJPEG_STATUS_ARCH_MISMATCH (7)
The device capabilities are not enough for the set of input parameters provided (input parameters such as backend, encoded stream parameters, output format).


NVJPEG_STATUS_INTERNAL_ERROR (8)
Error during the execution of the device tasks.


NVJPEG_STATUS_IMPLEMENTATION_NOT_SUPPORTED (9)
Not supported.


NVJPEG_STATUS_INCOMPLETE_BITSTREAM (10)
Bitstream input data incomplete
